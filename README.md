  Hi, I'm Evan Palmejar and I'm a marine engineer transitioning into the tech industry.
  
  Iâ€™m currently learning more about data science and engineering and I'm building up my portfolio of projects.
  You can go ahead and check my Programming Exercises repo, and see my work. 
  
  Please leave your comments and suggestions about my work, and how I can become better as a programmer.
  I would really appreciate it!


## About Me
  After sailing onboard tanker ships for over 5 years, I am currently learning
  programming for data science and engineering. 

  My interest in programming started with basic web development with HTML and CSS, and I eventually 
  branched out to data science and engineering, where I was able to find answers to my questions.
  I believe this passion for learning that I have is the driving force that keeps me motivated to this day.
  I genuinely enjoy learning something new and being able to apply it beyond of what I think I was capable of.


## Let's Work Together
  I enjoy working with curious people who have a passion for lifelong learning. I believe surrounding
  yourself with inquisitive and creative people from different backgrounds is a great way to maximize your
  own potential. I always consider my coworkers as friends, and that humor is a great way to lighten a stressful day.
  
  I also enjoy accomplishing my to do lists, neatly organizing my notes, and brewing my own cup of coffee.


## The Values I Believe In
  - Teamwork & Honesty<br>
  - Discipline & Hard Work<br>
  - Trust & Compassion<br>
  - Positivity & Humility<br>
  - Growth & Community
