## Hi, I'm Evan
  Hi, I'm Evan Palmejar and I'm a marine engineer transitioning into the tech industry.
  
  Iâ€™m currently learning more about data science and engineering and I'm building up my portfolio of projects.
  You can go ahead and check my Programming Exercises repo, and see my work. 
  
  Please leave your comments and suggestions about my work, and how I can become better as a programmer.
  I would really appreciate it!


## About Me
  After sailing onboard tanker ships for over 5 years, I am currently learning
  data science and analytics. 

  My interest in creative storytelling and investigative reporting led me to transition towards the data science and analytics field.
  I believe my passion for learning is the driving force that keeps me motivated to this day.
  I genuinely enjoy learning something new and being able to apply it beyond of what I think I was capable of.


## Let's Work Together
  I enjoy working with curious people who have a passion for lifelong learning. I believe surrounding
  yourself with inquisitive and creative people from different backgrounds is a great way to maximize your
  own potential. I always consider my coworkers as friends, and that humor is a great way to lighten a stressful day.
  
  I also enjoy accomplishing my to do lists, neatly organizing my notes, and brewing my own cup of coffee.


## The Values I Believe In
  - Teamwork & Honesty<br>
  - Discipline & Hard Work<br>
  - Trust & Compassion<br>
  - Positivity & Humility<br>
  - Growth & Community
