## Hi, I'm Evan
  Hi, my name is Evan. I am a data analyst and former marine engineer capable of working with Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel.
  I continue learning more about data analytics and engineering and I'm building up my portfolio of projects.
  You can go ahead and check my Programming Exercises repo, and see my work. 
  
  Please leave your comments and suggestions about my work, and how I can become better as a programmer.
  I would really appreciate it!


## About Me
  I have a Bachelor's degree in Marine Engineering and a Master’s degree in Maritime Management. 
  Aside from my maritime background, I have also engaged myself in data analytics and data engineering courses and programs.
  
  In my previous career as a marine engineer, I was responsible for the daily operations and maintenance of the ship’s equipment and machinery. I was in charge of the documentation of the ship’s engineering operations in the Oil Record Book and Engine Log Book. I also led a technical team for risk reduction and disaster management.
  My experience at sea has given me a unique perspective in approaching every situation with adaptability, enthusiasm, and a sense of humour. 
  
  Currently, I am a data analyst working in the collection and analysis of both technical and commercial data in the maritime industry to aid executives in making data-driven decisions.

  I am particularly fond of data cleaning, data processing, and data visualization. I genuinely enjoy the challenges that are associated when it comes to dealing with messy  data.
  I continue to develop my skills and interest in data and analytics engineering, and data product development through various courses, programs, and projects. 
  I am very interested in being able to apply my skills in building an impactful product, and to learn from others during the process as well.

  In my free time, I enjoy reading personal development and business books, drawing architectural plans and spending time with my family and our dogs.

## Let's Work Together
  I enjoy working with curious people who have a passion for lifelong learning. I believe surrounding
  yourself with inquisitive and creative people from different backgrounds is a great way to maximize your
  own potential. I always consider my coworkers as friends, and that humor is a great way to lighten a stressful day.
  
  I also enjoy accomplishing my to do lists, neatly organizing my notes, and brewing my own cup of coffee.

## The Values I Believe In
  - Teamwork & Honesty<br>
  - Discipline & Hard Work<br>
  - Trust & Compassion<br>
  - Positivity & Humility<br>
  - Growth & Community
